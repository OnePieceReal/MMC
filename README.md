# Media Center on ARM Cortex-M3

## Project Description
This project implements a Media Center on the NXP LPC1768 microcontroller using the Keil uVision IDE and the MCB1700 development board. The system integrates multimedia functionality with interactive controls, showcasing the versatility of ARM Cortex-M3â€“based embedded systems.

The Media Center provides three core features. The Photo Gallery allows users to view bitmap images on the LCD screen with navigation supported by the onboard joystick. The MP3 Player streams audio from a PC via USB to the development board, with playback through the onboard speaker and volume control using the potentiometer. The Game Center includes two interactive games: Pong and Tic-Tac-Toe, the latter enhanced with a Minimax algorithm for intelligent gameplay.

This project highlights hardware-software integration, peripheral management, and real-time user interaction in embedded system design. By combining graphical interfaces, audio streaming, and game logic, it demonstrates how ARM-based platforms can support both performance and interactivity within a constrained embedded environment.
